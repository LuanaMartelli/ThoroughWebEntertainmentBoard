# ThoroughWebEntertainmentBoard
Third TWEB Project

## Context
This is a project done in the TWEB course and is the third part of the application called Gamification. The objective is to give the user important data in a fun way, like a game or in a fun display, so that the use of such data is easier and less boring.
In our project, we use the github data of the users, and we transpose it to a RPG character with stats corresponding with the data we found about him.

A simple single-app website on github pages allow a user to type any github username

## Token Github
The agent needs an OAuth token from github to be used efficiently. A file *userToken.json* must exist in the same folder as the agent with the following format :
```
{
   "token" : "convenientlyReadableTokenForAnExample"
}
```
